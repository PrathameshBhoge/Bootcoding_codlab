# Med Appoint
Designing the MedAppoint App involves creating a system that allows users to book slots for doctor appointments, ensuring that two users cannot book the same slot simultaneously.

## Bootcoding Project Case Study on Medical Domain

- Design Rest API for retrieving a list of available doctors in the MedAppoint system.
- Design Rest API for booking appointment with available slots in the MedAppoint system.
- Implement a simple authentication mechanism for the MedAppoint API.


### Additional Application Requirements
- Given a scenario where two users attempt to book the same appointment slot simultaneously, outline the steps the MedAppoint backend should take to prevent conflicts.
- Design the pagination mechanism for retrieving a list of patient appointments in the MedAppoint system. Provide flexibility of retrieving pages to user in endpoint.

### Identify Hidden Requirements
To identify hidden requirements or assumptions in the MedAppoint project, we need to make some hypothetical considerations based on common scenarios in healthcare appointment systems.
